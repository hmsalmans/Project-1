User Story
As a runner I want an application to provide me with all necessary information in one place.
When I open the application, 
I am greeted with a start page.
When I click 'Lets Run', 
I am then sent to the main page of the application.
When I arrive on the main page I am asked to allow my location,
I then see my current coordinates.
When I click 'plan your route',
I am then presented with a google map overlay centered and markered at my current location.
When I click 'check the weather',
I am then presented with my current locations weather conditions.
When I click 'search artist',
I am then presented with a link to my prefered artist top songs.

Thanks for using our app!
